@chapter  Classic calculus
The following arithmetic operations are implemented in the calculator:
@enumerate
@item
Addition - a + b
@item
Subtraction - a - b
@item
Multiplication - a * b
@item
Division - a / b
@item
Power - a ^ b
@item
Remainder of the division - a mod b
@item
Unary plus - +a
@item
Unary minus - -a
@item
To enter complex expressions use left and right brackets - (a)
@end enumerate
You can specify a complex mathematical expression using the constant X.
Enter the expression, click "=" and get the answer.

The following mathematical functions are implemented in the calculator:
@enumerate
@item
Computes cosine - cos(x)
@item
Computes sine - sin(x)
@item
Computes tangent - tan(x)
@item
Computes arc cosine - acos(x)
@item
Computes arc sine - asin(x)
@item
Computes arc tangent - atan(x)
@item
Computes square root - sqrt(x)
@item
Computes natural logarithm - ln(x)
@item
Computes common logarithm - log(x)
@end enumerate
Enter the expression, click "=" and get the answer.

@chapter Charts calculus

The calculator implements the possibility of plotting functions.
Enter the expression, click the "graph output" button.

@chapter Credit calculus

Provide a special mode "credit calculator" (you can take banki.ru and calcus.ru as an example):

Input: total credit amount, term, interest rate, type (annuity, differentiated)
Output: monthly payment, overpayment on credit, total payment
